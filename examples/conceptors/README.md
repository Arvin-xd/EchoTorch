# Conceptor Examples

Here we document EchoTorch's examples using the Conceptor framework for pattern recognition and regeneration.

## Figures

This section list the various figures implemented in the examples which can be found in the original document 
"Controlling Recurrent Neural Networks by Conceptors".
